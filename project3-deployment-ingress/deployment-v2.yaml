#Explain the changes you made to the deployment file
# The deployment file was updated to use a new image version (0.2.3) and a new text message ("VERSION 2") in the container args.
# The deployment strategy was also updated to RollingUpdate to ensure that the new version of the container is rolled out gradually.
# This will help to minimize downtime and ensure that the application remains available during the deployment process.
# Other way to do it is to use the command kubectl set image deployment/rolling-deploy rolling-container=hashicorp/http-echo:0.2.3 args="-text=VERSION 2" --record
# another way to do deployment different that RollinUpdate is Recreate, but this will cause downtime during the deployment process.
